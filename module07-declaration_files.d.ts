//.d.ts

// Declaration files in TypeScript are used to provide type information for existing JavaScript code or libraries. They help with type checking and provide IntelliSense support in TypeScript projects. The main.d.ts file is commonly used to declare the types for the main entry point of a module or library. It is usually located in the root directory of the project.

//example:

declare module "react-sprite-animator";

// This should quiet the error in your other files importing this external javascript module (if it is the case)

//EXTERNAL TYPE LIBRARIES

// However, it is better if you can install TypeScript declaration files for a specific library

`npm install --save-dev @types/<library-name>`;

// The command npm install --save-dev @types/<library-name> is used to install TypeScript declaration files for a specific library. These declaration files provide type definitions for the library, allowing TypeScript to provide better type checking and autocompletion for that library in your codebase. The --save-dev flag indicates that the dependency should be saved as a devDependency in your package.json file.
